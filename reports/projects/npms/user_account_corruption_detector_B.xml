    title="NPMS User Account Corruption Detector (B)"
    description="Allow NPMS admin to see accounts which may have an issue (such as thir Drupal account is pointing at a deleted Warehouse account).
    This version of the report uses whether a user has the town field filled in on their address as a basis for deciding which users are associated with the NPMS.
    (note that using the Town field is deliberate, as that is the most stable adress field over time, the other address fields have changed over time)."
